            "Ancient Survivors: Crocodiles have been around for about 200 million years, making them one of the oldest living reptiles, surviving the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs.",
            "Powerful Bite: Crocodiles have one of the strongest bites in the animal kingdom. Their bite force can reach up to 3,700 pounds per square inch (psi).",
            "Ambush Predators: Crocodiles are excellent hunters. They often lie in wait, partially submerged in water, and ambush their prey with a sudden burst of speed.",
            "Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination: The sex of crocodile hatchlings is determined by the temperature of the nest. Warmer temperatures tend to produce males, while cooler temperatures produce females.",
            "Efficient Swimmers: Crocodiles can swim at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour) by using their powerful tails.",
            "Long Lifespan: Crocodiles can live for a long time, with some species living up to 70 years or more in the wild.",
            "Social Creatures: Despite their reputation, crocodiles can be quite social. They communicate with each other through vocalizations, body postures, and even by blowing bubbles.",
            "Unique Heart: Crocodiles have a four-chambered heart, similar to birds and mammals, which allows them to efficiently oxygenate their blood.",
            "Parental Care: Female crocodiles are attentive mothers. They guard their nests and help their hatchlings reach the water after they emerge from the eggs.",
            "Diverse Diet: While they primarily eat fish and mammals, crocodiles are opportunistic feeders and will eat almost anything they can catch, including birds, reptiles, and even fruit."
